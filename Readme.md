# Guns N' Ghosts

Guns ‘N’ Ghosts is a ```top-down``` ```arena shooter``` that makes you constantly move, dodge enemies and adapt to new weapons. It's a little arcade game that humbly asks the question “*What if Pac-Man had a f\*ing Gun?*”.

### Features
* A scalable weapon system that allows to create a great variety of weapons that can play extremely different from one another.
* A scalable and generic system for object pooling that is used for shooting bullets, spawning enemies or dropping health packages.
* The game has responsive controls and a lot of attention to detail to ensure that the gameplay and interaction are smooth, juicy and fun. It uses the [camera shaker](https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/CameraShaker) component that I developed to add game feel to my Unity games. Check it out too!
