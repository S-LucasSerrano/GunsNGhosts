# Guns N' Ghosts

Guns ‘N’ Ghosts is a ```top-down``` ```arena shooter``` that makes you constantly move, dodge enemies and adapt to new weapons. It's a little arcade game that humbly asks the question “*What if Pac-Man had a Gun?*”.

Here I'm sharing the code and Unity project of the game. Not everything is perfect, it has some rough edges and some of the development was rushed. But it still has some amazing features that can show what I can do as a game developer and that can be useful to people who find it.
* There is a scalable weapon system that allows to create a great variety of weapons that can play extremely different from one another.
* There is an, again, scalable and generic system for object pooling that is used for shooting bullets, spawning enemies or dropping health packages.
* The game has responsive controls and a lot of attention to detail to ensure that the gameplay and interaction are smooth, juicy and fun. It uses the [camera shaker](https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/CameraShaker) component that I developed to add game feel to my Unity games.
