# Guns N' Ghosts

Guns ‘N’ Ghosts is an ```arcade``` ```top-down``` ```arena shooter``` that makes you constantly move, dodge enemies and adapt to new weapons.

This is a cool little personal project that I’ve developed to have some Game Design portfolio. You can play it directly in your browser from itch.io: https://lucasserrano.itch.io/gunsnghosts.

And you can read the game design documentation from here: [https://lucasserrano.notion.site/Guns-N-Ghosts](https://lucasserrano.notion.site/Guns-N-Ghosts-f54487c685e04fe2a48a9ed9e9bbdc8b)

Here I'm sharing the code and Unity project of the game. Not everything is perfect, it has some rough edges and some of the development was rushed. But it still has some amazing features that can show what I can do as a game developer and that can be useful to people who found it.
* There is a scalable weapon system that allows to create a great variety of weapons that can play extremely different from one another.
* There is an, again, scalable and generic system for object pooling that is used for shotting bullets, spawning enemies or dropping health packages.
* The game has responsive controls and a lot of attention to detail to ensure that the gameplay and interaction are smooth, juicy and fun. It uses the camera shaker component that I developed to add game feel to my Unity games.
